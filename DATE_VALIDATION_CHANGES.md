# Date of Birth Validation & Age Display

## Overview
Added intelligent date validation and real-time age calculation to the date of birth form in the account type selection flow.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Smart Date Validation

#### Dynamic Day Options
- The day dropdown now shows only valid days based on the selected month and year
- **Months with 31 days:** January, March, May, July, August, October, December
- **Months with 30 days:** April, June, September, November
- **February:** 28 days (29 in leap years)

#### Leap Year Detection
```typescript
private isLeapYear(year: number): boolean {
  return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0);
}
```

Examples:
- 2024: Leap year → February has 29 days
- 2023: Not a leap year → February has 28 days
- 2000: Leap year → February has 29 days
- 1900: Not a leap year → February has 28 days

#### Auto-Correction
- If user selects day 31 in January, then changes month to February → day is automatically cleared
- Prevents invalid date selection
- User-friendly: doesn't break the form, just resets the day

#### Date Validation Rules
1. **Valid date check:** Ensures the date actually exists (e.g., no Feb 30)
2. **Not in future:** Birth date cannot be in the future
3. **Complete selection:** All three fields (day, month, year) must be selected

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Age Display

#### Age Calculation
- Calculates age accurately based on the selected birth date
- Takes into account whether birthday has occurred this year
- Updates automatically as user selects/changes date fields

#### Display Format

**English:**
- Less than 1 year: "Less than 1 year"
- 1 year: "1 year old"
- 2 years: "2 years old"
- 3-10 years: "X years old"
- 11+ years: "X years old"

**Arabic (with proper grammar):**
- Less than 1 year: "أقل من سنة"
- 1 year: "سنة واحدة"
- 2 years: "سنتان"
- 3-10 years: "X سنوات"
- 11+ years: "X سنة"

#### Visual Design
- Beautiful blue gradient background
- Clock icon for visual indication
- Smooth fade-in animation when age appears
- Positioned between date inputs and continue button

### 3. ✅ Enhanced User Experience

#### Progressive Validation
- Fields are validated as user selects them
- Day dropdown adjusts immediately when month/year changes
- Age appears as soon as all fields are selected

#### Error Messages
- Clear error message if trying to continue with invalid date
- Bilingual support (English/Arabic)
- Uses toast notifications for user feedback

#### Button State
- Continue button is disabled until valid date is selected
- Visual feedback shows when button becomes active
- Prevents form submission with invalid data

## Technical Implementation

### Component Methods

```typescript
// Calculate maximum days in selected month
getMaxDaysInMonth(): number

// Check if year is leap year
isLeapYear(year: number): boolean

// Validate complete date
validateDate(): boolean

// Calculate age from birth date
calculateAge(): number | null

// Get formatted age display
get ageDisplay(): string | null

// Auto-adjust day if becomes invalid
validateAndAdjustDay(): void
```

### Reactive Updates
- Setters on year, month, and day trigger validation
- Change detection ensures UI updates immediately
- Age display recalculates on every change

### State Management
- Date validation integrated with localStorage saving
- Invalid days are cleared automatically
- Form state remains consistent

## Examples

### Example 1: Leap Year Validation
1. User selects: Year = 2024, Month = February
2. Day dropdown shows: 01-29 (29 days because 2024 is leap year)
3. User selects: Day = 29
4. Age displays: "1 year old" (if today is 2025)
✅ Valid date: February 29, 2024

### Example 2: Non-Leap Year
1. User selects: Year = 2023, Month = February
2. Day dropdown shows: 01-28 (28 days because 2023 is not leap year)
3. User cannot select day 29
✅ Prevents invalid date: February 29, 2023

### Example 3: Auto-Correction
1. User selects: Day = 31, Month = January, Year = 2023
2. Age displays: "2 years old"
3. User changes Month to February
4. Day is automatically cleared (February doesn't have 31 days)
5. Age disappears until valid date is reselected
✅ Form remains in valid state

### Example 4: Month with 30 Days
1. User selects: Year = 2023, Month = April
2. Day dropdown shows: 01-30 (April has 30 days)
3. User tries to select day 31 → Not available in dropdown
✅ Prevents invalid date: April 31

## Visual Design

### Age Display Styling
```scss
.age-display {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0f9ff 0%, #e0f2fe 100%);
  border: 1px solid #bae6fd;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

- Smooth fade-in animation
- Blue gradient matches system colors
- Icon + text layout for clarity
- Responsive on mobile devices

## User Flow

1. **Select Year** → Age range is calculated (but not shown yet)
2. **Select Month** → Day dropdown adjusts to show valid days
3. **Select Day** → Age is calculated and displayed
4. **Change any field** → Age updates immediately
5. **Continue button** → Only enabled when date is valid

## Error Prevention

### What Happens When...

| User Action | System Response |
|------------|----------------|
| Selects Feb 31 | Not possible - day 31 not shown for February |
| Selects April 31 | Not possible - day 31 not shown for April |
| Selects day 31, then changes to February | Day is automatically cleared |
| Tries to continue with incomplete date | Button is disabled |
| Tries to continue with invalid date | Error toast is shown |
| Selects future date | Validation fails, error toast shown |

## Internationalization

### English
- Error: "Please enter a valid date of birth"
- Age format: "X years old"

### Arabic
- Error: "الرجاء إدخال تاريخ ميلاد صحيح"
- Age format: Proper Arabic pluralization rules

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test Cases

1. **Leap Year February**
   - Select 2024 (leap year) + February → Should show 29 days
   - Select 2023 (not leap) + February → Should show 28 days

2. **Month Changes**
   - Select day 31 + January → Valid
   - Change to February → Day should clear
   - Change to April → Day should clear
   - Change to March → Day 31 should be valid

3. **Age Calculation**
   - Birth date 10 years ago → Should show "10 years old"
   - Birth date next month but last year → Should show correct age
   - Birth date today last year → Should show "1 year old"

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Year 2000 + February → Should show 29 days (leap year)
   - Year 1900 + February → Should show 28 days (not leap year)
   - Future date → Should show error when trying to continue

5. **UI Updates**
   - Age should appear as soon as all fields are filled
   - Age should disappear when any field is cleared
   - Continue button should enable/disable correctly

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- JavaScript Date object handles all calculations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- RTL support for Arabic language

## Performance
- Lightweight calculations
- No backend calls for validation
- Instant feedback to user
- Efficient change detection

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML form elements
- Proper labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear error messaging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Age Restrictions**: Add minimum/maximum age validation (e.g., 13+)
2. **Date Picker**: Add optional calendar picker in addition to dropdowns
3. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-select most common ages
4. **Validation Hints**: Show inline hints as user types
5. **Animation**: Add transitions when day options change
