# Alternative Solutions for Outlook Add-in Issues

Since the standard Outlook add-in approach isn't working, here are several alternative solutions:

## 🚀 **Solution 1: Standalone Web App (Recommended)**

I've created a standalone exam grader that works without Outlook integration:

## 🔧 **Solution 2: Browser Extension**

Create a browser extension that works with Outlook Web:

**Advantages:**

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// manifest.json for browser extension
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "AnaTaleb Exam Grader",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": ["https://outlook.office.com/*"],
    "js": ["content.js"]
  }]
}
```

## 📱 **Solution 3: Mobile App Integration**

Create a mobile app that integrates with Outlook:

**Features:**

Set up webhooks to integrate with Outlook:

4. No add-in installation required

## 📧 **Solution 5: Email Template System**

Create email templates with built-in grading:

**Implementation:**

## 🎯 **Solution 6: Microsoft Teams Integration**

Build a Teams app instead of Outlook add-in:

**Advantages:**
- Teams apps are more reliable
- Better integration with Office 365
- Easier deployment
- More user-friendly

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "manifestVersion": "1.16",
  "version": "1.0.0",

    "privacyUrl": "https://test.anataleb.com/privacy",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://test.anataleb.com/terms"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Solution 7: API-Based Integration**

Create an API that Outlook can call:

**How it works:**
1. User sends email details to API
2. API processes and grades
3. Returns results via webhook or email
